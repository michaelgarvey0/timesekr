    UI is the most popular React component library in the world.
    With as extensive of APIs provides, you can build extremely complex business applications with fewer lines of code.
    Other libraries offer great alternatives, as well as novel approaches to styling, but MUI has continued to provide the most sophisticated components like Autocompletes and Data Grids with a consistent API.

    question: 'Do you use Joy UI in building these components?',
    answer: `
    For the time being, no. As the library matures we will reconsider that decision, but the current resources for Joy UI are less extensive and less tested.
    Because of the large collection of components that the MUI Material library provides, we support it first and foremost.
